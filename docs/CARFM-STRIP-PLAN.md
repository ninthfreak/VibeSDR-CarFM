# CarFM strip-down plan

Goal: reduce the VibeSDR codebase to the CarFM car-FM-radio experience. Ranked by
**harm** = how likely removing the item breaks CarFM (its FM pipeline / build) or
demands risky surgery. Work top-down (🟢 first). Scope decisions already made:
**keep all receiver backends for now**; **full iOS removal**.

## Status
- ✅ **Items 1–9 DONE** (commits `a2d7a91`, `592f91f`): dead files, iOS project +
  pod, app.json ios block, `Platform.OS==='ios'` branches, BrowserOverlay, Apple
  Watch (watchProvider/watchBoot + all call sites), Siri + CarPlay (Android Auto
  kept).
- ⬜ **Items 10–19 remaining** (below).
- ⬜ **Other open items** from earlier in the project — see the last section so
  they aren't lost.

## The one structural fact that drives everything
- `CarFmFace.tsx` is **purely presentational** — 23-file import closure, zero SDR
  backends; it gets frequency/RDS/signal/stereo as **props**.
- `SDRScreen.tsx` (5182 LOC) is its **host**: it wires the tuner → CarFmFace props
  AND renders every non-FM feature inline. So `SDRScreen` is **core — never
  deleted**; removing features = **surgery inside it**.
- `InstancePickerScreen.tsx` is the **launcher** (navigates in with `carFm:true`) —
  keep, trim.

## CORE — never remove (the CarFM keep-set)
- `CarFmFace.tsx` + all `src/components/carfm/*`
- `SDRScreen.tsx` (host — trim, don't delete), `InstancePickerScreen.tsx` (trim)
- FM/RDS/station/logo services: stationFinder, stationDb, stationTypes, stationGeo,
  stationLogo, stationLogoCache, logoResolver, logoWikidata, logoSiteFavicon,
  radioBrowser, piCallsign, rdsCountry, callsignCountry, ptyLabels, base64
- Pipeline/output: UberSDRClient, UberSDRAdapter, SDRBackend, localSession,
  nowPlaying, carMode, sdrTypes, instancesApi (`getUserLocation`), favourites,
  defaultInstance, AudioPlayer/`VibePowerModule`, LocalAudioPlayer, imaAdpcm
- All `android/` native (Kotlin + cpp) + `sdr-kit/` (29 MB, Android runtime dep)

## 🟢 LOW harm — safe, do first (isolated / dead / iOS-inert on Android)
1. **VTSDisplay.tsx** — orphaned, imported nowhere. Pure delete.
2. **si470xTuner.ts** — dead (zero importers; only a disabled SettingsPanel row names `'si470x'`). Delete unless Si470x USB tuner is on the roadmap.
3. **`app.json` → `expo.ios` block** — config only.
4. **`ios/` directory** (incl. `VibeSDRWatch/` Apple-Watch app, 3 MB) — Android build never touches it; JS native names are satisfied by the Kotlin modules.
5. **`modules/vibe-local-sdr/`** — the iOS pod + prebuilt `.a` + `build_ios.sh`. iOS-only. (Keep `android/.../cpp` — `build_ios.sh` referenced it, but Android needs it.)
6. **`Platform.OS === 'ios'` cosmetic branches** — App.tsx, modals (ChatDrawer, FreqModal, PasswordModal), `mdns.ts`. Simplify to the `else` path. Mechanical.
7. **BrowserOverlay.tsx** — one small SDRScreen-only overlay. Clean lift-out.

## 🟡 MODERATE harm — bounded surgery (inline overlays / shared screens / iOS wiring)
8. **Apple Watch** — `watchProvider.ts` (~45 KB) + `watchBoot.ts`. iOS-only, but invoked from App.tsx **boot logic**, SDRScreen (~30 calls), TunerScreen (~15), WaterfallView; `watchBoot.claimed` is also read by the **Android carFm boot branch** (App.tsx:288). Untangle the boot gate carefully.
9. **Siri + CarPlay** — iOS voice/car blocks in SDRScreen (~186–262, 1491, 1904, 1910). Bounded, but the **Android Auto** side is shared — keep that when cutting CarPlay.
10. **Recording** — RecordingsOverlay.tsx + AudioSheet.tsx (12 SDRScreen refs). Shared with **TunerScreen** — edit both call sites. Keep AudioPlayer/`VibePowerModule`.
11. **Browser/server-sharing screens** — ServerModeScreen + RtlTcpServerScreen (+ rtlTcpServer, vibeServer, vibeAuth, mdns). Clean screen deletes, but **backend-adjacent** (you deferred backend decisions) → confirm before cutting.
12. **FM-DX client** — TunerScreen + FmdxDial (+ FmdxAdapter, fmdxDirectory). Clean screen-level removal, but FM-DX is a **reception source you deferred** → decide as a set.
13. **VTS + HF bookmarks** — VTSBar.tsx + services `stations`, `eibi` (shortwave schedules), `userBookmarks`. HF/ham band-plan engine, no FM role.

## 🔴 HIGH harm — deep SDRScreen surgery / shared pipeline (do last, carefully)
14. **Decoders** — DecoderPanel + DecoderImageCanvas + `DecoderClient` + native `cpp/decoders`. **76 SDRScreen refs** — the most coupled subsystem. `DecoderClient` is the shared backbone for **decoders + chat + map spots**, so items 14/15/16 must be planned together.
15. **Chat** — ChatDrawer.tsx + DecoderClient chat transport. Shared with TunerScreen; rides on DecoderClient.
16. **Maps & aircraft** — MapOverlay.tsx + AircraftPanel.tsx. Shares DecoderClient spot rows.
17. **GPU waterfall** — WaterfallView.tsx (1353 LOC, inline Skia shaders). **39 SDRScreen refs**, ~40 wired props; also read by watchProvider. Hidden under the CarFM overlay anyway.
18. **Non-FM demod modes** — ModeSelector + StepPicker + the mode/step **state machine** in SDRScreen + `dataModes` (DAB/ADS-B). CarFM forces `wfm`; stripping the rest is state-machine surgery.
19. **The whole "Advanced SDR view"** — ControlsBar (978) + MenuSheet (1691) + DrumWheel + the entire non-car UI branch of SDRScreen. Only visible when NOT in CarFM. Biggest cut: means splitting SDRScreen's FM-wiring from its SDR-UI. Highest harm; likely the final step (and gated on whether CarFM keeps an "advanced" escape hatch at all).

## Removal-order notes
- Do 🟢 first (each is independent and low-risk), then 🟡, then 🔴.
- **DecoderClient cluster (14–16)** must go together — chat + maps + decoders share it.
- **Backend-adjacent items (11, 12)** are parked pending your "decide backends later".
- After each cut: `tsc --noEmit` + a harness render of the CarFM face to confirm the FM pipeline still feeds it.

# Other open items (carried over — do not lose)

Threads raised across the project that are NOT part of the strip list.

## A. Design — device-only verification (a still harness can't check these)
- ⬜ **The three animations** on an on-device screen recording: hero prev/next
  swap FLIP (LOSSY #9, 520ms), preset-reorder FLIP (300ms), seek-digit slide
  (±14 / 0.25→1, ~200ms). Built to spec but never verified in motion.
- ⬜ **Font-scale ×1.3 / ×1.5** — no overlap; frequency stays amber (§10/§11).
- ⬜ **Peek-card callsign exposure** at true 360dp portrait (renders fine on wide;
  the tall sliver is just too narrow to read in a still).
- ⬜ **Post-strip smoke test** — after items 8/9, confirm Android Auto + app boot
  on a real APK (removed code was iOS/watch no-ops, but SDRScreen wasn't run).

## B. Rebrand / separation loose ends
- ⬜ **EAS `projectId` + `owner: stuey3d`** in `app.json` — still the original
  author's Expo account; run your own `eas init` before building.
- ⬜ **Internal docs still say "VibeSDR"** — `docs/STORE-SUBMISSION.md`, the
  `BRIEF-*.md` set, `files/*.md`. Not shipped, but inconsistent.
- ⬜ **Native VibeServer web-page title** — `android/app/src/main/cpp/vibe_web_page.h`
  still `<title>VibeSDR</title>` (native; out of the scope you set earlier).
- ⬜ **`APPSTORE-EXCEPTION.md`** — Stuart's GPLv3 §7 store-distribution exception;
  moot for an Android-only fork. Decide keep vs remove.
- ⬜ **README positioning** — currently "a fork of VibeSDR, a mobile SDR receiver"
  (what the code is). If CarFM is really the *car FM radio* product, give the
  positioning and it gets refocused.

## C. About screen — authored content (needs your voice, I won't fabricate)
- ⬜ **`AboutOverlay.tsx` personal message** is still **Stuart's** first-person
  origin story (PSKR badge, M9PSY, "Pocket UberSDR"). Offered to *neutralize* it
  to a factual fork note rather than rewrite it in your voice — pending your call.
- ⬜ **Changelog / version history** in AboutOverlay is VibeSDR's release history
  (App Store, TestFlight, "new in vN") — inherited, not CarFM's. Decide keep/trim.

## D. Logos — future polish (feature works; these are refinements)
- ⬜ **Logo sizing / fit** — better optimize how fetched logos are sized and laid
  out in the tiles (wide wordmarks vs square marks, padding, `resizeMode`, upscale
  of small hits). Deferred by request; the search + assign + display pipeline is
  working as of 2026-07-20.
