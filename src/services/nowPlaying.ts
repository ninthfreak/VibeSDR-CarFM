// FM MediaSession metadata mapping for the CarFM build.
//
// Gadgetbridge relays Android MediaMetadata (title / artist / album) into its
// music messages, which it forwards over BLE to the ESP32 display. So this
// mapping IS this app's contract with the rest of the system. Per the CarFM
// spec §5b the sensible default (tune later against how the ESP32 renders it):
//
//   RadioText (RT)    -> TITLE   (the per-song / rolling text)
//   Station name (PS) -> ARTIST  (stable identifier)
//   Frequency         -> ALBUM
//
// FM has no track position/duration and RDS carries no album art, so neither is
// faked here: the native session leaves position unset and reuses the app icon.
