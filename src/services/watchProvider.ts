/**
 * Apple Watch remote-view provider.
 *
 * The watch is a thin client. This module owns the whole phone->watch view path:
 * raw dBFS bins in, a VFO-centred 256-byte row out over WCSession.
 *
 * IT RUNS OFF THE RAW SPECTRUM, NOT OFF THE WATERFALL COMPONENT. That is
 * deliberate and load-bearing: the PRIMARY use case is the phone locked in a
 * pocket, and on lock the app unmounts the Skia canvases and cancels every
 * animation driver, so anything hanging off WaterfallView is dead exactly when
 * the watch matters most. We therefore keep our own SignalProcessor, fed the same
 * settings the phone's renderer uses, so the wrist looks identical without
 * depending on a component that is deliberately torn down.
 *
 * Everything here must stay in the "safe to run while backgrounded" class: plain
 * JS plus one native bridge call. No Skia, no Reanimated/worklets, no per-frame
 * React state — those are what starved the audio DSP in the v6 regression.
 *
 * The palette travels as data: the phone's own 256-entry RGBA LUT, rather than
 * reimplementing 26 colour maps in Swift.
 *
 * Direction of truth: phone owns frequency/mode/step; the watch sends DELTAS and
 * mirrors whatever the phone echoes back.

 *  instead, which is sharp. It costs 256 bytes a row (~1.3KB/s at 5fps). */

/** Row cadence — 10fps, and rows are BATCHED TWO TO A MESSAGE on the native side.
 *
 *  It was 60ms (~16/sec). The DATA was never the problem — a row is 317 bytes, so even
 *  16/sec is ~5 KB/s and Bluetooth doesn't notice. THE MESSAGE RATE was the problem:
 *  WCSession.sendMessage is an INTERACTIVE channel (individually framed and queued,
 *  meant for occasional request/response), and we were making sixteen calls a second at
 *  it, forever. Far outside its design envelope — and that is what kept wedging it,
 *  backing it up, and leaving it silently ONE-WAY after a transport hop.
 *
 *  THE MIDDLE POSITION. 60ms + 2 rows per message = EIGHT messages a second instead of
 *  sixteen: the channel is still driven half as hard (which is what was wedging it),
 *  but full temporal resolution is restored and a pair now completes in 60ms rather
 *  than 100ms.
 *
 *  100ms + batching (5 msgs/sec) was tried and the LAG WAS VISIBLE — a voice would
 *  start and the trace would lift a moment later. The audio never crosses the watch
 *  link, so it always arrives first; every millisecond we add to the picture widens
 *  that gap. Halving the message rate buys most of the reliability; the second halving
 *  cost more than it was worth.
 *
 *  Original note follows, still true:
 *  Row cadence: ~10fps of REAL data.
 *
 *  It was 5fps, on the theory that interpolation hides a low frame rate the way
 *  VibeServer's web client does. That conflated two different things:
 *  interpolation hides a low FRAME RATE, it cannot recover MISSING DATA. The
 *  synthesised in-between rows are linear blends of two real rows — they smooth
 *  the scroll but carry no information. At 5fps half the spectrum frames were
 *  simply discarded, and on SSB speech the energy genuinely changes on a ~100ms
 *  timescale: a syllable peeking up between two sampled frames was gone for good.
 *  The result looked fluid and read as mush.
 *
 *  (VibeServer gets away with 5fps because you're watching a broadcast signal
 *  that's essentially stationary. Hunting SSB conversations is the opposite case,
 *  and that is what the watch is FOR.)
 *
 *  MUST SIT WELL CLEAR OF BOTH SOURCE INTERVALS, not just under one.
 *
 *  It was 90ms — just under the ~100ms of the LOCKED feed (half-rate FFT). Any
 *  jitter (a frame landing 85ms after the last) failed the gate, so that row was
 *  dropped and the next one didn't arrive for 200ms. Locked, that gave an
 *  irregular ~8fps full of 200ms holes, which the jitter buffer and the trace's
 *  EMA then smoothed over — and it read exactly as "the averaging has been
 *  cranked right up". Awake (20fps source) a frame was always ready the instant
 *  the gate opened, so it was a rock-steady 10fps. Same gate, two behaviours.
 *
 *  At 60ms: the locked 100ms feed passes EVERY frame with room for jitter, and
 *  the awake 50ms feed still halves cleanly to ~10fps. */
