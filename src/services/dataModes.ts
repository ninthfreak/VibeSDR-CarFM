/**
 * Modes where the PROFILE IS THE CONTENT — and tuning inside it is meaningless.
 *
 * These are not "modes you happen to be in". They are whole-profile modes: the
 * server dedicates the receiver to a fixed block (a DAB ensemble, the 1090 MHz
 * ADS-B channel, an ISM band) and decodes it. There is nothing to hunt for and
 * nowhere to go — the only thing a VFO can do is drag you OFF the block, which
 * kills the decode and is a nuisance to re-find.
 *
 * This existed already, but only for DAB, as the literal string 'dab' hardcoded
 * into five separate guards (the drum, the waterfall tap, direct tune, bandwidth,
 * and the watch crown). ADS-B had NO guard at all, so the crown would happily tune
 * you off 1090 MHz and stop the aircraft decoding. One predicate, consulted by every
 * guard, so the next data mode can't fall through the same gap.

 * usb/lsb/nfm sideband, so those you DO tune.)
 *
 * DAB is here for the same reason even though it isn't a digimode — it's locked to
 * its ensemble block.

 * NOT included, deliberately: 'drm'. It's a whole-profile primary mode on the wire,
 * but it's a broadcast you genuinely tune between stations of.
