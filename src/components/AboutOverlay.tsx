const STUART_MESSAGE: string[] = [
  'Hi, my name is Stuart (Stuey3D) and I am the UI designer and tester for this project.',
  "VibeSDR came about from the frustration of trying to use extremely powerful WebSDR servers on mobile devices, only to be served a broken website that wasn't optimised for mobile and tried to fit the entire desktop site onto a phone screen. I'd had an idea for a mobile-optimised SDR interface for a while, but I am not a developer and I don't know how to code, so I had no way of realising my UI ideas.",
  "After some back and forth with M9PSY, the creator of the amazing UberSDR web SDR software, he made a basic mobile web UI for UberSDR — some desktop assets reused and repositioned for mobile — but most of UberSDR's cool features, such as the decoders and maps, were still not available to users. I had helped M9PSY test various features over the previous few weeks and suggested new ones, and he encouraged me to make my own add-ons for UberSDR, since it already had sections where a user could add their own code for info banners or badges. I told him I was no coder, but he said just get AI to do it — I was good at testing and providing feedback, and that's all the AI needed.",
  "A bit sceptical, I started by getting ChatGPT to create a simple PSKReporter tracking badge, which grew to be quite sophisticated with all sorts of stats tracking and graphs. I was amazed at how quickly I got it to such an advanced level — even though with ChatGPT you'd fix one thing and break ten others, so many hours were spent testing everything. During this time, at my suggestion, M9PSY added a widget gallery to UberSDR that lets a user add up to ten widgets to their page — so my PSKR badge was suddenly a widget any UberSDR instance owner could install at the click of a button.",
  'I was so excited about my progress with the PSKR badge that I chatted to M9PSY about it, and he said: "I\'ll let you into a little secret — Claude is better."',
  "So with that knowledge I embarked on my next widget: a search bar for the bookmarks, as at the time UberSDR lacked a bookmark search feature. Guessing M9PSY was probably fed up with me badgering him for new features, I decided to build my own bookmark search (which is part of this app too). It turned out very well, so I showed it off to M9PSY — who said he had already built a bookmark search but hadn't enabled it yet. That being said, I asked whether his refreshed dynamically during a session, as the EiBi bookmarks change with station schedules. His loaded once on page load and that was it — so my search bar had more functionality, having discovered the dynamic bookmarks early.",
  'M9PSY kept encouraging me and explained that a widget is HTML code that loads last and can be very powerful — even removing the entire UI and replacing it. Interesting, I thought: maybe Claude and I could build a UI skin that would make controlling UberSDR better.',
  'Over 500 builds of the UI — which I dubbed Pocket UberSDR at the time — Claude and I managed to get around 90–95% of the full UberSDR desktop functionality running in a mobile-optimised interface. We got most of the radio decoders working on-device, plus viewers for the on-server add-ons such as Digital Spots, CW Spots and HFDL aircraft tracking. I even beat M9PSY to getting server-side noise reduction working on mobile.',
  'That UI was a labour of love, with many late nights and early mornings spent testing on multiple devices and reporting back, and it became what I truly believe to be the ultimate mobile SDR interface. M9PSY openly admits he is old skool and doesn\'t really use mobile devices, so mobile was much lower down his priority list for UberSDR. Armed with my new confidence, and with Claude by my side, I like to think I successfully saved him a job.',
  "One big issue remained: my UI was an optional skin/widget for UberSDR, and for everybody to be able to use it, individual instance owners would need to add it to their servers. I felt a little deflated — most users set up their instances, forget them, and leave them running without even adding the cool new features M9PSY has been building (such as 24/7 server-side WEFAX/SSTV/NAVTEX decoding), so what chance did my UI have if server owners wouldn't add it? And then it hit me: I'll make an app I can share directly with users. Like Thanos, I thought \"Fine, I'll do it myself\" — and the app you are using is the result of that thought.",
  'When you load the app you are taken to the instance list, where you can set a default that loads straight away (ideal for instance owners, or if you simply have a favourite). And regardless of whether the instance owner has added my UI to their server, you get the full mobile-optimised interface — tested all the way down to a 4-inch screen (iPhone SE in Display Zoom mode).',
  "I am extremely proud of this app. It has been a labour of love and a lot of testing — but I am simply one man with no coding experience, just a vision and a tool (Claude) to realise that vision. I also believe in openness and honesty, and I will never hide the fact that this app was coded with AI — which is why it is called VibeSDR, to really lean into the vibe-coding aspect of it. I know some people do not like AI, due to its resource usage and the amount of slop posted daily on social media. For me, I would not feel happy sharing this app if I hadn't tested it as much as one man can, and the name VibeSDR was chosen so that people who are anti-AI can choose not to use this app if they feel that's right for them.",
  "Is this app perfect? Probably not. Will there be bugs? Yeah, probably. I have genuinely spent hours upon hours testing, and a lot of time fixing tiny things like alignment issues that would have been \"good enough\" — but I wanted them perfect. I really hope that when you use this app you can see the thought and love that have gone into it, and that everything is laid out logically.",
  "Well, that's it — my app-creation history laid out bare. I hope you enjoy this app as much as I enjoyed making it.",

const VERSION_HISTORY: { v: string; detail: string }[] = [
  { v: 'V1', detail: 'Initial version — UberSDR support only, using the server-provided waterfall and spectrum.' },
  { v: 'V2', detail: "Fully native rewrite with a custom GPU waterfall/spectrum stack (V1's headline future plan, delivered), native audio with background playback and media controls, on-device decoders, chat, bookmarks and much more — see What's New above." },
  { v: 'V2.0.1', detail: 'Bug fixes: bandwidth sliders now match the server’s 6 kHz limit (were going to 8 kHz), and bookmark/band-plan search shows the full result list in a scrollable dropdown (previously capped at 25 results, so higher bands like 20m were cut off).' },
  { v: 'V2.1', detail: 'In-car upgrades: Android Auto now shows browsable Bookmarks and Band Plan lists (tap to tune), not just skip buttons. Band-aware tuning sets the right demodulator and step for each band — applied when you pick a band from the search list, and automatically as you cross band edges while connected to a car (handheld tuning is never changed automatically). CarPlay browsing is ready for when the entitlement is in place.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.1', detail: 'Band-aware mode/step now also applies to remote tuning — lock screen, Apple Watch and connected headphones — not just the car. It still stays out of your way while you’re hands-on tuning with the VFO drum on the waterfall.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.2', detail: 'Band-aware tuning tweaks: utility and beacon (NDB) ranges now default to USB / 500 Hz, and the 11m CB band follows the receiver’s ITU region — NFM in Europe/Asia-Pacific, AM in the Americas.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.3', detail: 'Media-control skips (lock screen, Apple Watch, Android Auto, headphones) now snap to the step grid like the VFO drum — so skipping from an off-grid frequency lands on a clean multiple of the step rate.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.4', detail: 'Fixes a frozen waterfall when returning to the app after another audio app suspended it (it now reconnects on its own). Adds a Data Saver: after a chosen spell muted — lock screen, AirPods out, or pause — the SDR stream disconnects to stop wasting data and battery. Pick the timeout under Power Saving (Off / Instant / 5–30 min); the media controls show a countdown, then “Open App to Resume”, and Play reconnects.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.6', detail: 'Data Saver moved to the main menu (under Controls). Pause now genuinely pauses on iOS — the lock-screen button no longer springs back to play, and the app stops grabbing shared AirPods from a Mac while paused. The Admin section is now labelled “Instance Admin”.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.7', detail: 'When another app takes over audio (e.g. a Mac grabbing your shared AirPods, or another media app on the phone), VibeSDR now registers it as a mute — the muted banner shows and the Data Saver countdown starts — instead of silently sitting connected. Works on both iOS and Android now. Press Play to come back.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.8', detail: 'The album art now reflects state at a glance: the server-logo corner becomes a muted-speaker with the minutes-to-disconnect while paused, and a disconnected icon once the Data Saver drops the stream.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.9', detail: 'Resuming after a Data Saver disconnect now does a full from-scratch reconnect (new session) instead of reopening the old one — fixes the frozen waterfall / dead-audio state that previously needed a trip back to the instance list.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.10', detail: 'Data Saver polish: while paused the media controls show a static “auto-disconnect at HH:MM to save data & power”, and once it disconnects the controls are released entirely (no half-working Play button). Reopening the app fully reconnects and unmutes.' },
  { v: 'V2.1.11', detail: 'Simpler pause/play: pause now disconnects and play reconnects (the server lets the session go on suspend anyway, and reconnecting is near-instant) — no more mute timeout or countdown. The media card shows a clear Disconnected state, and a “Failed to reconnect — open VibeSDR” state with an ⚠️ if the server is full or busy. Also fixes the SNR meter drifting with zoom level (the noise floor is now measured zoom-independently; dBFS and S-meter were already fine).' },
  { v: 'V2.1.12', detail: 'SNR meter now reads radiod’s channel SNR (baseband power − noise density) straight from the audio stream — the demodulator’s own measurement of the tuned channel — so it’s accurate against the local noise floor and completely independent of the waterfall zoom. (Corrected for radiod’s +30 dB audio-floor offset, so it stays honest 0–50 dB rather than the inflated 30–80 dB.)' },
  { v: 'V2.2', detail: 'Siri voice control (iOS). Say "Hey Siri, tune VibeSDR" — Siri asks what — then a frequency (7.150 MHz / 7150 kHz / 7151.5), a station ("Radio Caroline"), or a band ("40m ham", "CB"). It tunes with the right demodulator + step, honouring any spoken mode. When a name matches several bookmarks (e.g. "Radio 5") Siri reads the frequencies and you pick by voice; "China Radio at 11 MHz" narrows the list. Also "change VibeSDR mode" → AM / SAM / synchronous AM / LSB / lower side band / …, and "set VibeSDR step rate" → 100 Hz, 9 kHz, … It runs in the background while VibeSDR is playing, so it works over headphones / CarPlay / the lock screen without unlocking. (Tuning is a two-step ask-and-answer — Apple only allows a value inside a one-shot Siri phrase for fixed lists. Android’s in-car answer stays the Android Auto Bookmarks/Band-Plan browse — Google Assistant needs Play Store publishing.)' },
  { v: 'V2.2.1', detail: 'In-car fix: a Siri voice command interrupts the car audio session, which paused and disconnected VibeSDR — it then sat dead until you pressed Play. It now auto-resumes (reconnects on the new frequency) the moment Siri finishes, with no manual Play. A genuine takeover by another app (e.g. a Mac grabbing your AirPods) still waits for Play, as before.' },
  { v: 'V2.2.2', detail: 'Store-readiness pass: clearer location prompt (it’s only for sorting/filtering instances by distance, and denying it changes nothing else); removed two unused Android permissions (microphone and draw-over-other-apps); added a privacy policy and an App Store distribution exception to the GPL licence. No functional changes.' },
  { v: 'V3', detail: 'Multi-backend release — VibeSDR now speaks three SDR server protocols (UberSDR, OpenWebRX/OpenWebRX+ and KiwiSDR) behind the same interface, with a new directory chooser in the instance picker. (KiwiSDRs have very few slots, so owners choose who connects — some refuse apps or block broadcast bands. A refusal or sudden drop is the owner\'s restriction, not a fault in VibeSDR.)' },
  { v: 'V4', detail: 'Local SDR hardware — VibeSDR now runs a radio on-device. Plug an RTL-SDR into an Android phone over USB (“Local Hardware”), or connect to a networked rtl_tcp server from either platform, and the app demodulates AM/SSB/CW/NFM/WFM itself with a bundled on-device DSP core — full waterfall, drum, audio and decoders, with a hardware-control submenu. Adds an MMSE noise-reduction engine and an adaptive Auto Notch (on every backend), plus a client-side dBFS squelch for KiwiSDR. (V5 later replaced that DSP core with VibeSDR’s own clean-room engine.) See What\'s New above.' },
  { v: 'V5', detail: 'New on-device DSP engine — SDR++ Brown (and FFTW and VOLK) have been REMOVED and replaced with VibeDSP, VibeSDR\'s own clean-room, GPL-free signal-processing engine for Local Hardware and RTL-TCP. It is hand-optimised with ARM NEON SIMD throughout, so it runs noticeably cooler and lighter on the battery — especially on low-end phones and tablets — while matching the old engine. It also brings real improvements: true single-sideband SSB (proper image rejection, not double-sideband), genuine FM stereo with a 19 kHz pilot PLL + RDS, a per-channel audio AGC for SSB/CW, working de-emphasis (50/75 µs), a reliable stereo indicator and a force-mono switch. See What\'s New above.' },
  { v: 'V5.0.1', detail: 'CW fix for Local Hardware (USB RTL-SDR): tuning straight onto a CW signal used to go silent — the beat-note offset and the actual filter width had drifted apart, so the morse was only audible when tuned well off the signal. They\'re now kept in sync, so a signal tuned dead-on gives a clear, audible ~600 Hz tone with readable morse. The mode pill also reads “CW” to match the button.' },
  { v: 'V5.1', detail: 'Unlocked VFO + waterfall panning, and a saved-recordings player. A new VFO Lock toggle (menu) lets you free the waterfall: locked (default) is exactly as before, unlocked lets you drag to pan the band while staying tuned, with a floating “Centre on VFO” button. Gestures are now tap-to-tune, drag-to-pan, pinch-to-zoom, with panning moved onto the UI thread for smoothness on poor connections. On Local Hardware / RTL-TCP the dongle (RF) centre becomes a true second VFO — with the VFO unlocked you can pan the view across the full captured bandwidth at native resolution while a station stays tuned, the dongle locking at the capture edge with an RF-CENTRE marker and hard walls. New Recordings screen lists, plays (with scrub), shares and deletes your recordings in-app — no more recordings stranded in storage. See What\'s New above.' },
  { v: 'V5.1.1', detail: 'OpenWebRX squelch & noise reduction now follow the server’s presets. If a server owner has set a default squelch level on a profile (e.g. a 2 m NFM profile at −65 dB) — or an initial noise-reduction level — selecting that profile now applies it automatically, with the menu sliders updated to match, instead of staying off or stuck on your previous setting. Matches the OpenWebRX web client’s behaviour.' },
  { v: 'V5.1.2', detail: 'iOS 26/27 audio fix. On iOS 27 the audio could go silent after a while even though the connection looked fine — the underlying audio socket was stalling (reporting alive while frames quietly stopped). The native audio path was moved onto Apple’s Network framework, with a session safety-net that keeps the stream rendering, fixing the dropouts. iOS-only.' },
  { v: 'V5.1.3', detail: 'Polish + reliability. New first-launch info screen explaining the power-saving behaviour (the waterfall fully freezes in the background by design and takes a moment to resume). Returning from the background now shows a calm “Reinitialising” notice while the waterfall comes back, instead of a misleading “Connection lost” — and if the spectrum genuinely fails to resume while audio keeps playing, you get a clear reconnect / instance-list prompt. Fixed a swipe-up-from-the-home-bar gesture that could nudge the tuning, and fixed the menu’s MIN / MAX zoom buttons (full-out / full-in) which previously did nothing.' },
  { v: 'V5.1.4', detail: 'KiwiSDR servers don’t support chat, so the Chat button is now greyed out and disabled while you’re connected to a KiwiSDR — the Share button stays available. No other changes.' },
  { v: 'V5.1.5', detail: 'Android layout fix: on phones using the classic three-button navigation bar, the menu’s CLOSE button could sit underneath the system buttons and be hard to tap. The menu now respects the navigation-bar inset so CLOSE always clears it. No effect on gesture-navigation devices. Android-only.' },
  { v: 'V5.2.0', detail: 'Deep linking (early feature, still being rolled out). A vibesdr:// link — and a QR code from an UberSDR instance — can open VibeSDR straight onto that instance, optionally at a set frequency and mode. The link/QR side is still being built on the UberSDR end, so not every instance offers a link yet. The share button now also includes an “Open in VibeSDR” app link alongside the web link. Opening a link no longer bounces back to your default instance.' },
  { v: 'V5.2.1', detail: 'Privacy: the optional location used to sort the instance list by distance is now taken and shared at approximate (coarse, ~1 km) accuracy only, instead of a precise fix. Location stays entirely optional and every other feature works without it.' },
  { v: 'V5.2.2', detail: 'iPad and tablet polish. The signal meter now frames the frequency correctly on tablets (the coloured level showed above and below the readout on phones but not on larger screens), and the on-screen decoders (RTTY, NAVTEX, WEFAX, SSTV, Morse) now work in landscape on tablets, which have the room a phone doesn’t. The HAPTICS toggle is now hidden on devices with no haptic motor (all iPads, and any Android tablet without one) so it’s no longer a dead button.' },
  { v: 'V6.1.0', detail: 'Networked RTL-SDR. VibeSDR now auto-discovers rtl_tcp servers on your Wi-Fi (via Bonjour/mDNS) and lists them under a new “Discovered” section — no IP typing needed (iOS and Android). And on Android you can now share a plugged-in RTL-SDR over the network as an RTL-TCP server, so an iPhone or any rtl_tcp client can use the dongle remotely — handy for a good antenna location or an always-on phone. Includes an optional bandwidth cap, an editable name shown to other devices, and a live status notification. Plugging in an RTL-SDR on Android now asks whether to listen on the device or share it. The location and local-network permission prompts also now explain exactly what they’re for.' },
  { v: 'V9.0.0', detail: 'The Apple Watch companion \u2014 the waterfall itself, live on your wrist, drawn from the same data and the same palette as the phone. Turn the Digital Crown to tune, tap the frequency to type one, press and hold for the menu (demodulator, tuning step, zoom, servers). It works with the iPhone LOCKED IN YOUR POCKET, which is the whole point \u2014 and it will start the phone for you: open the watch app with VibeSDR closed and the phone wakes in the background, connects to your default receiver, and the waterfall arrives on your wrist without the phone screen ever coming on. Four screens, chosen by what the receiver actually is: spectrum waterfall, FM-DX tuner (station, distance, RDS), DAB service list, and ADS-B aircraft. Switch receivers from your favourites without touching the phone. Control the iPhone\u2019s system volume and mute from the wrist \u2014 it reads the phone\u2019s REAL volume, including changes you make on the phone, so the two can never disagree. It shows the band you\u2019re in, in words, from the ITU plan for wherever the RECEIVER is, with marks on the ticker showing where that band ends \u2014 and your watch\u2019s own battery, because this is an app you might leave running on a hilltop. When the link is rough it tells you WHICH link: there are two radio hops in the chain (phone-to-server, watch-to-phone) and they fail independently, so a small diagram shows which one is struggling, over a waterfall that keeps drawing. \u2014 FIXED: the waterfall could freeze for good on a locked phone on mobile data and never come back, while audio and tuning carried on working perfectly. A mobile network can silently invalidate a connection without ever closing it, and nothing was watching for that: the spectrum socket sat there, open and dead, forever. VibeSDR now actively probes the link, rebuilds it the moment it stops answering, and reacts instantly when the phone changes network. \u2014 VibeServer: the web client now shows the server\u2019s NAME as well as its address, so there is no IP to remember. FIXED: on first use its sample-rate box read 3.2 MS/s while the receiver was actually running at 2.4 \u2014 it now defaults to 2.4 (the fastest an RTL-SDR can reliably sustain), tells the receiver so the two agree, and marks the higher rates as liable to drop samples. FIXED: on a 1366\u00d7768 laptop the control bar\u2019s buttons overlapped and the signal readout ran off the edge of the window.' },
  { v: 'V8.0.1', detail: 'Fix: saved favourites could start connecting as a VibeServer instead of the UberSDR receiver they actually are \u2014 and the wrong answer was then saved back onto the favourite. VibeSDR now identifies a VibeServer by a marker only a real one carries, and repairs any favourites that were mislabelled.' },
  { v: 'V8.0.0', detail: 'VibeServer \u2014 turn an Android phone with an RTL-SDR into a receiver anyone on your network can use, from a browser or from VibeSDR itself. The serving phone does all the DSP and sends compressed audio and a ready-made waterfall, so it is roughly 25\u00d7 lighter on the network than raw RTL-TCP and works comfortably over Wi-Fi or a hotspot. Point any browser at the phone\u2019s address and you get the full VibeSDR client \u2014 waterfall and spectrum with the same palettes, click-to-tune, panning and cursor zoom, audio with recording, the decoders (RTTY, NAVTEX, WEFAX, SSTV, FT8 with its map), station search, bookmarks you can export, and OS media controls with artwork. Access is protected by a PIN using challenge-response, so the PIN itself never crosses the network, and you can switch the web client off entirely so only the VibeSDR app can connect. You can leave clients free to choose their own bandwidth, or pin it \u2014 pinned, their picker disappears and says the server set it. The receiver can publish its own location (opt-in, never assumed) by device position or by naming a town or Maidenhead locator, and clients then show the receiver\u2019s name and place, and measure spot distances and band edges from the ANTENNA rather than from wherever the listener happens to be. If the app is killed while serving, the server rebuilds itself and carries on. \u2014 The RTL-TCP box becomes CUSTOM SERVER: type any address and VibeSDR works out what is listening (VibeServer, OpenWebRX, KiwiSDR, UberSDR, FM-DX, rtl_tcp or SpyServer), so one box reaches every backend. Local hardware is now RTL-SDR, with Listen and Use as server side by side. \u2014 Fixes: entering a frequency in a different band now switches to the right demodulator and span (jumping from a medium-wave station to FM used to leave you in AM with a 5 kHz filter); the waterfall no longer shows half a minute of stale history after a big jump; the lower sample rates (0.96 and 1.2 MHz) no longer break up; rtl_tcp no longer plays chipmunks on some rates; dragging the gain slider no longer breaks the audio; panning past the tuned station no longer drops audio or crawls; and auto-contrast now defaults to 5 (10 was too dark). \u2014 The receiver also NAMES THE STATIONS IT CAN HEAR: when a station announces itself over RDS, VibeSDR remembers it against the frequency, so the search bar fills itself in with what this aerial actually receives. It keeps itself honest \u2014 the PI code spots a different broadcaster on a frequency immediately, and a station that goes unheard for 30 days expires rather than sitting on top of static. The name is reconstructed by majority vote across repetitions, so it can recover a name no single transmission delivered cleanly. Save stations to the receiver (shared with everyone) or to your own browser, and import an existing list to either. \u2014 Point a browser at vibesdr.local: no IP address to remember, and a second phone serving on the same network renames itself automatically. \u2014 Station logos and country flags now actually appear, on every backend and on AM and shortwave too, not just FM; where the country genuinely cannot be known (a station arriving on sporadic-E, say) VibeSDR declines to show a flag rather than showing your own country\u2019s.' },
  { v: 'V7.1.0', detail: 'SpyServer compatibility, a reorganised audio menu, and today’s fixes. VibeSDR now connects to SpyServer receivers via sdr:// links (tap one anywhere, or paste sdr://host:port into the Custom URL box) and can save them as favourites — low-bandwidth, so good over mobile data. All audio controls (noise reduction, noise blanker, squelch, auto-notch, recording + playback) moved into a new Audio button to declutter the main menu; the demodulator popup gained the bandwidth sliders and Share moved next to the frequency keypad. You can now favourite the receiver you’re listening to straight from the menu. Every menu section gained a small icon for easier scanning. On FM-DX, recording/library moved into the same Audio button. Fixes: sharing a recording no longer freezes the controls; the waterfall no longer blanks on USB/RTL-TCP at full zoom-out; and iOS cold-start deep links open the linked instance.' },
  { v: 'V7.0.1', detail: 'Networked-radio stability and two iOS fixes. Sharing an RTL-SDR over a phone hotspot or busy Wi-Fi is far more reliable: the sharing phone now holds a Wi-Fi lock so its radio can’t drop into power-save mid-stream, the receiving side keeps a short buffer so a brief Wi-Fi stall no longer breaks the audio, and the sharing screen shows a live link-health indicator. iOS: FM stereo now actually plays in stereo on local hardware and RTL-TCP (it was quietly downmixed to mono), and scanning a QR code or opening a vibesdr:// link with the app closed now goes to the correct receiver instead of your default one.' },
  { v: 'V7.0.0', detail: 'FM-DX Webserver support — a whole new kind of receiver. VibeSDR now connects to the worldwide network of FM-DX Webserver tuners (from servers.fmdx.org): real, remote FM broadcast tuners you share with other listeners. New vintage-radio tuning dial that learns and pins every station name as you tune across the band, full RDS (station name, RadioText, PI code, PTY, TP/TA, stereo), a dBf signal meter, transmitter details (site, power, distance and bearing from the receiver), tap-to-tune alternative frequencies, station logos and country flags. Because the tuner is shared, there’s built-in chat, a listener counter, and the lock-screen skip buttons are disabled so you can’t accidentally retune it for everyone. The demodulator button opens mono/stereo, cEQ, iMS and an antenna switch (when the server offers one). Station logos and country flags now also appear on local RTL-SDR and networked WFM using the RDS PI code, with an on-device logo cache so they persist even offline. Pausing from the lock screen disconnects to save battery and reconnects on play.' },
  { v: 'V6.0.0', detail: 'A major under-the-hood upgrade for iOS 27. VibeSDR now builds on React Native’s New Architecture (required for iOS 27 / Xcode 27 support, since Apple no longer accepts the older toolchain). Alongside that: RTL-SDR local hardware and RTL-TCP tuning is fixed — typing a frequency now retunes cleanly first time (it previously needed a nudge of the tuning drum), a race in the on-device tuner has been eliminated. Local Hardware and each RTL-TCP source now remember their own last frequency, mode and hardware settings independently (including VHF/UHF stations, which used to reset). Plugging an RTL-SDR into an Android phone and choosing “Open in VibeSDR” now goes straight to Local Hardware instead of your default instance. On Android, background audio now correctly holds up on devices that aggressively restrict apps — if your phone is throttling VibeSDR in the background, the app now detects it and shows you how to allow background usage. Plus the first-launch tutorial no longer appears on top of the welcome screen.' },

The VibeDSP engine could implement these demodulators, but the audio codecs behind them are legally encumbered for a shipped app: HD Radio sits on Xperi’s patent portfolio, DAB+ and DRM on HE-AAC/xHE-AAC codec licensing, and DMR, D-STAR, Fusion and NXDN on the AMBE/IMBE vocoder patents. Shipping unlicensed implementations in App Store or Play Store builds is a risk VibeSDR will not take. Genuinely open digital voice modes — Codec2-based FreeDV and M17 — are unencumbered and remain candidates for native support.',
      'The supported route: many OpenWebRX / OpenWebRX+ servers decode digital modes server-side. When you select such a mode on one of those servers, VibeSDR simply plays the already-decoded PCM audio the server sends — no demodulator or codec ships in, or runs inside, the app. That’s why DAB+ works in VibeSDR on some servers despite none of these decoders existing in the app itself.',

Lock-screen and in-car skip buttons would let you change the station for people you can’t see, so they’re disabled out of courtesy while connected to FM-DX. You’ll see a reminder on the lock-screen artwork too. It’s the same principle behind the connection warning when you join an FM-DX server: one tuner, many listeners.'],

  'It works with the iPhone LOCKED IN YOUR POCKET, which is the whole point. It will even start the phone for you: open the watch app with VibeSDR closed and the phone wakes up in the background, connects to your default receiver, and the waterfall arrives on your wrist without the phone screen ever coming on.',

And your watch’s own battery, next to the clock, because this is an app you might leave running on a hilltop.',
  'When the link is rough, the watch now tells you WHICH link. There are two radio hops in the chain — phone-to-server, and watch-to-phone — and they fail independently. A small diagram shows which one is struggling, over a waterfall that keeps drawing; tuning goes on working throughout, and the app says so rather than throwing up a blank screen.',
  'FIXED: the waterfall could freeze for good on a locked phone, on mobile data, and never come back — while audio and tuning carried on working perfectly. A mobile network can silently invalidate a connection without ever closing it, and nothing was watching for that: the spectrum socket sat there, open and dead, forever. VibeSDR now actively probes the link, rebuilds it the moment it stops answering, and reacts instantly when the phone changes network (Wi-Fi to mobile and back).',
  'VibeServer: the web client now shows the server’s NAME as well as its address (vibesdr-yourphone.local), so there is no IP to remember, and it survives your router handing the phone a different address tomorrow.',
  'VibeServer FIXED: on first use the web client’s sample-rate box showed 3.2 MS/s while the receiver was actually running at 2.4 — it was reporting a rate the radio was not using. It now defaults to 2.4 MS/s (the fastest an RTL-SDR can reliably sustain), tells the receiver so the two agree, and marks the higher rates as liable to drop samples.',
  'VibeServer FIXED: on a smaller laptop screen (1366×768 and below) the control bar’s buttons overlapped each other and the signal readout ran off the edge of the window. The whole bar now scales properly down to 1280×720.',

VibeSDR works out what kind of server it is talking to by looking at its web page — and it was treating the word “VibeSDR” as evidence of a VibeServer. But UberSDR receivers carry a “open in VibeSDR” link of their own, so a perfectly ordinary UberSDR looked like one of ours. Worse, the wrong answer was then saved back onto the favourite.

The decoders run on the server, so a browser never has to do any DSP.',

The station’s PI code keeps it honest — a different broadcaster on the same frequency is spotted immediately — and the name is reconstructed by majority vote across repetitions, so it can recover a name that no single transmission delivered cleanly.',
  'Receiver location, opt-in. Granting location to sort a server list is not consent to broadcast your position, so publishing stays off until you choose it: use the device’s coarse position, name a town, or give a Maidenhead locator (which needs no internet — the shed case). Clients then measure spot distances, map centring and the regional band plan from the ANTENNA, not from wherever the listener happens to be sitting.',
