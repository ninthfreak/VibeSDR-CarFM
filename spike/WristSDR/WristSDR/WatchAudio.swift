///    completion, and it will REFUSE if there is no usable route — that refusal is a
///    real answer, not an error to paper over.
///  - `.longFormAudio` is the route-sharing policy that lets audio keep playing with the
///    wrist DOWN. Without it the watch is happy to stop the moment the screen sleeps,
///    which for a radio is the same as not working.
///  - The built-in SPEAKER is only a media route on the newer watches (Series 9+/Ultra).
///    On older ones this will land on Bluetooth or fail — which is precisely the device
///    split the JR brief predicted, and precisely what this spike exists to confirm.
