# Xcode Cloud post-clone step for VibeSDR (Expo / React Native bare workflow).

# Installs Node + JS deps + CocoaPods after Xcode Cloud clones the repo, so the
# archive can bundle the JS and link the pods.
#
# WHY XCODE CLOUD: our local build machine is on a BETA macOS (27.x); App Store
# Connect rejects binaries built on a beta OS (ITMS-90111), even with stable
# Xcode 26.6. Xcode Cloud builds on Apple's STABLE macOS images. Keep using this
# until macOS 27 ships stable.

# Run natively on arm64. Xcode Cloud runners are Apple Silicon, but the script
# can land in an x86_64/Rosetta shell (Intel Homebrew at /usr/local), which makes
# CocoaPods refuse ("Do not use pod install from inside Rosetta2"). Re-exec once
# under arm64 so brew/node/pods are all native and consistent.

# JS dependencies.
#
# THE FALLBACK MUST START FROM A CLEAN TREE. It was `npm ci || npm install`, and that is a
# trap: npm ci runs `postinstall` (patch-package) as its LAST step, so a ci that dies late
# leaves node_modules ALREADY PATCHED. The `npm install` fallback then runs patch-package a
# second time over a patched tree — and our expo-modules-jsi patch CREATES a file, so
# re-applying it fails ("Failed to apply patch"), which fails the postinstall, which fails
# the whole script under `set -e`. The fallback could never have succeeded.
#
# So the retry deletes node_modules first. It is also worth SAYING that ci failed and why,
# because the fallback used to hide it — the build only ever reported the second, confusing
# error, never the first, real one.
