/// Scrolling RGBA pixel buffer for the wrist waterfall.
///
/// Three things conspire to make a naive implementation judder, and each needs
/// its own fix:
///
///  1. **WCSession is not a stream.** It delivers rows in BURSTS — several land
///     together, then nothing for a few hundred ms. Blitting on arrival lurches
///     no matter how you interpolate, because during a gap there is nothing to
///     interpolate towards. Fix: a JITTER BUFFER — queue arrivals, drain on a
///     steady clock (`tick`). Same medicine as the rtl_tcp client buffer.
///  2. **The feed is ~10fps**, so one row per frame is a slow march of fat bands.
///     Fix: INTERPOLATE UP — synthesise `subRows` blended rows between each pair
///     of received rows, so the waterfall scrolls at ~20 rows/sec.
///     But know what this buys: interpolation hides a low FRAME RATE, it does NOT
///     recover MISSING DATA. We tried 5fps and it read as mush — on SSB speech the
///     energy changes on a ~100ms timescale, so half the syllables were simply
///     never sampled, and no blend brings them back. Smooth is not the same as
///     legible.
///  3. **Scaling.** 256 bins is ABOVE the watch's ~205pt width, so the image is
///     DOWNscaled — sharp. (It was 128, which meant upscaling every column 1.6x:
///     a self-inflicted blur no sharpening can undo.) Bilinear still smooths the
///     row banding vertically, and the fat bins from a zoomed-out phone.
