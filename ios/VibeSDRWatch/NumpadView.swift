/// Direct frequency entry — laid out like the system passcode pad.

/// That layout fits on one screen precisely because it is ONLY the digits, so
/// everything else has to get out of the grid's way: the readout goes above it,
/// backspace appears beside the readout only once there is something to delete,
/// and the bottom row's two spare slots become "." and TUNE.
///
/// The unit is asked AFTER you commit, not before: you dial the number you were
/// thinking of, then say what it was. ("7.155" is three different frequencies —
/// and no ham typing a CW frequency wants to spell out 7155000.)
///
/// A native TextField was tried and abandoned: watchOS gives it the ALPHANUMERIC
/// input surface, so Scribble reads "1" as "l" or "I", and the keys are too small
/// to hit. There is no public API for Apple's own numeric pad.

    // not, and the clock only occupies the RIGHT of it — so leaving the left half
    // empty was donating ~40pt of a 251pt screen for nothing. Putting the
    // frequency there reclaims it, starts the digits directly under the clock, and
    // gives the X and backspace a home that costs no height at all.
    //
    // Ignoring the top safe area is therefore CORRECT here (it was wrong before,
    // when nothing was drawn up there: GeometryReader reported the full screen
    // while the content sat below the clock, so the keys were sized for space we
    // never had). Now we genuinely use the band, so the full height is genuinely
    // ours.
    // Size off the HARDWARE, not GeometryReader.
    //
    // GeometryReader kept reporting the SAFE-AREA height (215pt) while the view
    // actually drew into the full screen (251pt) — so the keys were sized for a
    // screen smaller than the one they were on, leaving ~50pt of dead space. It
    // had earlier reported the opposite and pushed the bottom row off. Rather than
    // keep guessing which number SwiftUI means, ask the device: screenBounds is
    // unambiguous.

    // cornerInset: the display is a ROUNDED rectangle but every measurement we get
    // is a plain one, so anything drawn into the corners gets eaten by the curve.
